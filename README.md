# Modding guide
The mod title should be the same as the folder name  
The game supports image of any size in PNG JPEG formats, each dimension must be, independently, a power of two  
But, to avoid lag spikes while loading images, it's better to stick to recomended sizes in px  
Suika skin sprite = 256-512  
Suika ui icon sprite = 128-256  
Container skin sprite = 256-512  
In game background = phone screen resolution in 16:9, 18:9, 21:9 ratio  
Loading screen background = phone screen resolution in 16:9, 18:9, 21:9 ratio  
Loading icon = 128-256  
Character skin = 128-512  
The game supports audio files in MP3 WAV OGG formats  

Modding tool (soon)
