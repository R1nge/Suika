# Modding guide
The mod title should be the same as the folder name  
The game supports image of any size in PNG JPEG formats  
But, to avoid lag spikes while loading images, it's better to stick to recomended sizes  
Suika skin sprite = 256-512  
Suika ui icon sprite = 128-256  
Container skin sprite = 256-512  
In game background = phone screen resolution in 16:9, 18:9, 21:9 ratio
Loading screen background = phone screen resolution in 16:9, 18:9, 21:9 ratio
Loading icon = 128-256
